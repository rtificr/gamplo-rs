# Gamplo SDK

Provides a Rust interface for the Gamplo API. Based on [Gamplo's JavaScript SDK](https://gamplo.com/developer/sdk) and is designed to be used in both server-side and client-side (WASM) Gamplo games. For more information/examples, [read the SDK documentation](https://gamplo.com/developer/sdk)

Supports all Gamplo API endpoints; [see the API reference](https://gamplo.com/developer/api). Designed to closely mirror [the JavaScript SDK](https://gamplo.com/developer/sdk).
